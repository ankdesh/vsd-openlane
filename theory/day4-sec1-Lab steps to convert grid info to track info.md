## Lab steps to convert magic layout to std cell LEF
Important points 
* Ports do not mean anything to magic
* Port information is required by the LEF files
* When the design is extracted as LEF, ports become the pins of macro
* More details at https://github.com/nickson-jose/vsdstdcelldesign?tab=readme-ov-file#create-port-definition
